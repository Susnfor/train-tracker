## About The App

Train Tracker is more than just a train information app – it's a solution born out of my own frustrations with missed disruptions and the need for a seamless travel experience on the London Underground (TfL). As a commuter, I understand the importance of staying in the loop, and Train Tracker is here to make your journey stress-free and efficient.

### Key Features:

**Real-Time Insights:** Tired of missing disruptions? Train Tracker keeps you in the know about the live operational status of all TfL train lines, ensuring you're never caught off guard by delays or unexpected changes.

**One-Page Convenience:** Say goodbye to navigating through multiple pages to find what you need. Train Tracker simplifies your experience by providing all the information you need on one page. Quickly check service statuses, disruptions, and even search for the next train arrival time at your station without the hassle.

**User-Friendly Design:** Designed with commuters in mind, Train Tracker offers an intuitive and friendly interface, making it easy for you to access the information that matters most.


Embark on a smoother London Underground journey with Train Tracker – a personal project to make your daily commute a little easier and a lot more enjoyable.
